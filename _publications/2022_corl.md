## Abstract
Robust planning in interactive scenarios requires predicting the uncertain future to make risk-aware decisions.
Unfortunately, due to long-tail safety-critical events, the risk is often under-estimated by finite-sampling
approximations of probabilistic motion forecasts. This can lead to overconfident and unsafe robot behavior, even with
robust planners. Instead of assuming full prediction coverage that robust planners require, we propose to make
prediction itself risk-aware. We introduce a new prediction objective to learn a risk-biased distribution over
trajectories, so that risk evaluation simplifies to an expected cost estimation under this biased distribution. This
reduces the sample complexity of the risk estimation during online planning, which is needed for safe real-time
performance. Evaluation results in a didactic simulation environment and on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.
