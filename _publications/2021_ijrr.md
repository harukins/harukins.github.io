## Abstract
We propose a novel belief space planning technique for continuous dynamics by viewing the belief system as a hybrid 
dynamical system with time-driven switching. Our approach is based on the perturbation theory of differential equations 
and extends sequential action control to stochastic dynamics. The resulting algorithm, which we name SACBP, does not 
require discretization of spaces or time and synthesizes control signals in near real-time. SACBP is an anytime 
algorithm that can handle general parametric Bayesian filters under certain assumptions. We demonstrate the 
effectiveness of our approach in an active sensing scenario and a model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning problem. 
In these challenging problems, we show that the algorithm significantly outperforms other existing solution techniques 
including approximate dynamic programming and local trajectory optimization.
