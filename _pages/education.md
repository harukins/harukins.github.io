## LETS: Learn Engineering with Tokyo University Students<a name="lets"></a>

LETS is a team of science and engineering educators that originated as a project-based course officially named Science
Understanding Promotion Project （工学理解促進プロジェクト）, which had been offered at the University of Tokyo until the 
Winter of 2015.
The course was a part of the Creative Engineering Project series that provide UTokyo undergrads and grad students 
hands-on experiences on a variety of engineering-related topics. 
In LETS, students would form groups of 4-5, where each group designed a unique science lesson on the topic of their choice.
The lessons would be eventually delivered to elementary school children in the local neighborhood twice in a semester.
One distinctive feature of LETS was a lesson design strategy based on learning sciences; we would primarily use 
[How People Learn](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/9853/how-people-learn-brain-mind-experience-and-school-expanded-edition) 
as a textbook to grasp how crystallization of knowledge occurs in the learning process, and reflect it into our design
choices, in order to respect pre-existing knowledge of the children and promote their knowledge transfer. 
I joined LETS in 2014 as a junior student, then served as the TA in the Summer of 2015.

As a project-based course, LETS had two learning goals. One was for the children in public elementary schools to get 
exposed to cool STEM topics, learning how basic principles lead to sophisticated engineering technology that is nowadays
fundamental to our daily life. 
The other was for the UTokyo students to gain deeper understanding of the basic yet complex scientific concepts, 
to the extent that they could readily communicate them with people whose pre-existing knowledge is very different from
theirs. Through this experience the students would obtain skills to explain technical matters without using too much 
jargon or intricate equations.

Over the years we offered a variety of lessons, whose topics include design of earthquake-resistant structures,
surprising relationship between heat transfer and warm clothes, secrets of colors induced by light, and so on.
Although LETS is not offered as a course anymore, we still volunteer to organize science workshops on occasion.
