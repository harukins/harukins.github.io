Welcome to Haruki Nishimura's website! I am a Ph.D. student at Stanford University, currently in my final year, 
advised by Prof. [Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/) in 
[Multi-Robot Systems Lab](https://msl.stanford.edu/).
I am passionate about making mobility systems safer and more reliable in the upcoming era of automation.
I develop advanced trajectory planning algorithms for mobile robots that must interactively operate without
failure under perceptual, dynamic, and model uncertainty. Those algorithms leverage tools from numerical optimization, 
optimal decision/control theory, probabilistic inference, and machine/reinforcement learning. 
This [TechXplore article](https://techxplore.com/news/2020-10-framework-safety-robots-crowded-environments.html) can be
a nice introduction to get a feel for the kind of research that I do.

I received my M.S. degree from Stanford University in 2017 and B.Eng. from The University of Tokyo in 2015, both in 
Aeronautics and Astronautics. At UTokyo, I was researching feature-based aerial SLAM algorithms for life-logging 
applications, under the supervision of Prof. [Takehisa Yairi](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/research/people/staff-yairi_takehisa.html)
at the [Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

Apart from research activities, I am passionate about stargazing, traveling, as well as 
[science/engineering education]({% link _pages/education.md %}).
