Welcome to Haruki Nishimura's website! I am a Senior Research Scientist at [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/), focused on Trustworthy Machine Learning under Uncertainty.
Prior to joining TRI, I was a Ph.D. student at Stanford University, advised by Prof. [Mac Schwager](https://web.stanford.edu/~schwager/) in 
[Multi-Robot Systems Lab](https://msl.stanford.edu/).
I am passionate about making embodied autonomous systems safer and more robust so people can truly trust and rely on them in the AI-assisted society of the near future.
Since 2018, I have developed advanced trajectory planning and learning algorithms for autonomous robots that must interactively operate without
failure under perceptual, dynamic, and model uncertainty. Those algorithms leverage tools from numerical optimization, 
optimal decision/control theory, probabilistic inference, reinforcement learning, and statistics.
This [TechXplore article](https://techxplore.com/news/2020-10-framework-safety-robots-crowded-environments.html) can be
a nice introduction to get a feel for the kind of research that I do.

I received my Ph.D. degree and M.S. degree from Stanford University in 2021 and 2017, respectively, and B.Eng. from the University of Tokyo in 2015, all in 
Aeronautics and Astronautics. At UTokyo, I was researching feature-based aerial SLAM algorithms for life-logging 
applications, under the supervision of Prof. [Takehisa Yairi](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/research/people/staff-yairi_takehisa.html)
at the [Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology](https://www.rcast.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

Apart from research activities, I am passionate about stargazing, traveling, as well as 
[science/engineering education]({% link _pages/education.md %}).
