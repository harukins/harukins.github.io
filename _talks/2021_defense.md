Recent advances in perception, planning, and control have enabled mobile robots to perform complex human-level
tasks in many industrial domains. However, most of the robots still lack the capability to consider and address
uncertainty, which demands that they be caged or confined to a dedicated, structured workspace. To enable reliable
autonomy for "cage-free" robotic operations, this thesis will present computationally efficient algorithms for 
trajectory planning that can collectively overcome environmental and dynamic uncertainties existing in open, interactive
environments. Our approach leverages probability theory and optionally machine learning to quantify the amount of
present and future uncertainty. Based on the quantification, we develop online methods for model-based planning and
control that either mitigate, avoid the risk of, or are robust against uncertainty to successfully accomplish a given 
task. Relevant tasks include active perception, Bayesian reinforcement learning for mobile manipulation, and safe
autonomous navigation in human crowds. The methods presented in this thesis will ultimately allow intelligent mobile
robots to operate in considerably more uncertain and dynamic workspaces than the current industrial standard. This
will open up possibilities for various practical applications, including autonomous field robots for persistent
environmental monitoring, fully automated driving on urban roads, and autonomous drone flights in densely populated
areas for logistics services.
